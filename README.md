# ao3-blacklist
A place where the css code to block problematic content on ao3 is placed! 

Hello! Thank you for taking interest in this project of mine!
I plan to create a comprehensive blacklist and spreadsheet with the ao3 users of those blacklisted to help others in the fandom
Right now, only JJK is included but I will likley expand this at some point.

Things that get you on the JJK ao3 blacklist:
- minor x adult content (including curses x students)
- incest
- beastiality

Have any suggestions? Please let me know on tumblr or through here. 
Have I made a mistake and/or have you encountered a creator you want to add? Let me know!

A word of warning: do NOT harass any of the individuals in this blacklist.

I may not condone their actions but witchunting/threatening/hunting down these creators is unacceptable. 
This blacklist was created to limit contact with problematic content in the fandom but is by no means an 
invitation to harass or attack others.
