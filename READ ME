Hello! Thank you for taking interest in this project of mine!
I plan to create a comprehensive blacklist and spreadsheet with the ao3 users of those blacklisted to help others in the fandom
Right now, only JJK is included but I will likley expand this at some point.

Things that get you on the JJK ao3 blacklist:
- minor x adult content (including curses x students)
- incest
- beastiality

Things that I may add in the future:
- adult characters x sukuna

Have any suggestions? Please let me know on tumblr or through here. 
Have I made a mistake and/or have you encountered a creator you want to add? Let me know!
